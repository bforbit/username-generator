# username-generator

 This is a custom username generator that I came up with while learning to use JavaScript. After completing the Password Generator project at Scrimba, I wanted to go the extra mile and create extra customizations, like random character amounts and an additional word to the username.
 
 This particular project gave me a chance to revisit Grid designing in CSS, and I used Figma in sketching the design of the page.
